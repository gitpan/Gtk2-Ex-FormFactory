Revision history and release notes for Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory:

0.55 Mon Jul 11, 2005, joern
	Features:
	- Added a fully functional tutorial program (a simple music
	  database) which makes use of a lot of simple and advanced
	  Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory features. Not documented yet, but
	  nevertheless a good example to learn how Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory
	  works. More details in tutorial/README.
	- On demand loading of widget modules saves some memory
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Context
	  - pass object aggregation information to define
	    dependencies between objects. This way all dependent
	    objects update automatically if their parent object
	    changes.
	  - defining constant attribute accessors is now possible,
	    e.g. for simple Combo presets not changing at runtime.
	  - new method set_object_attr() sets an specific application
	    object attribute and triggers corresponding GUI updates
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::List
	   - new attribute "selects_object" for lists representing
	     an index of objects to select one of them. The
	     corresponding widgets are updated automatically
	     once the list selection changes.
	   - new attribute "visible" to control visibility of columns
	   - new attribute "no_header" to suppress list headers
	   - new attribute "attr_select_column" to have specific
	     column values instead of selected indices in the
	     "attr_select" attribute
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Label: declare an arbitrary Label
	  widget as the label of another widget, so this label is
	  deactivated/activated together with the assigned widget
	  automatically, even in complex layouts.
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Popup: additional data model,
	  two dimensional array to define ordered key/value pairs.
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Window: title may be controlled
	  by an application object.
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Widget: moved get_widget() from
	  Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory to here, so it's available for
	  all widgets, not only in a FormFactory.

	Bugfixes:
	- Removed ok_hook() from Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Intro
	  documentation, which was never implemented that way.
	- Tooltips on combo entries didn't work.

0.54 Sun May 29, 2005, joern
	Features:
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Table now handles arbitrary
	  alignments of widgets in the cells.
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory: new convenience method
	  change_mouse_cursor().
	- Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Layout: no frames around
	  forms if placed on a notebook page

0.53 Sun Apr 10, 2005, joern
	Features:
	- $ff->get_widget($name) added.
	- $context->remove_object($name) added.
	- DialogButtons: control the set of buttons displayed.

	Bugfixes:
	- Timestamp: placeholders were mixed up, so the calculated
	  timestamp was nonsense for some values.
	- Widget's changed_hook wasn't called at the appropriate
	  time for some widgets.
	
0.52 Sun Feb 06, 2005, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Popup: didn't consider custom attribute activity conditions
	  in all cases.
	- Container: apply_changes() didn't recurse correctly into
	  all children

	Features:
	- New widgets:
	  - CheckButtonGroup: a table of check buttons representing
	    a multiple selection of predefined values.
	  - GtkWidget: support arbitrary Gtk widgets which aren't worth
	    an own Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory module.
	  - TextView: a Gtk2::TextView
	  - Timestamp: Entries to enter correct timestamps down to minute
	    level, while calculating internally with unix timestamps.
	- FormFactory: added parent_ff attribute
	- FormFactory: added hide parameter to open() and show() method
	- FormFactory: added open_confirm_window() method
	- FormFactory: added get_image_path() method
	- Button: added stock attribute
	- Combo: added presets attribute
	- DialogButtons: buttons may now be controlled with the object
	  attribute's value
	- HBox/VBox: added no_frame attribute
	- List: added update_selection_only attribute
	- Proxy: get_attr/set_attr consider object.attr notation
	  accordingly and switch to the proxy of the correspondent
	  object for convenience.
	- Table: warn if table layout string contains tab characters
	- Widget: added gtk_properties_widget
	- Widget: added label_markup attribute
	- Widget: added 'type' option to show_error_message() and
	  error windows are now modal.
	  => WARNING: incompatible API change!
	- Window: added closed_hook attribute

0.51 Mon Dec 27, 2004, joern
	Bugfixes:
	- Container: on cleanup the internal content list was
	  set to undef instead to [].
	
	Features:
	- Context: attr_depends_href extended, so it accepts a list
	  reference of attributes an attribute depends on, not
	  only a single attribute.
	- Image: with a constant scale of 1 all magic regarding scale
	  calculation is switched off
	- Window: if a window has a FormFactory parent, FormFactory->close()
	  is called automatically when the window is destroyed.
	- Container: Print a better error message if a child of a
	  container isn't defined.

	Notes:
	- Added GPL LICENSE file to the distribution
