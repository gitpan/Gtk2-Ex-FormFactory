ABSTRACT
    With Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory you can build a GUI which consistently
    represents the data of your application.

DESCRIPTION
    This is a framework which tries to make building complex GUI's easy, by
    offering these two main features:

      * Consistent looking GUI without the need to code resp. tune
        each widget by hand. Instead you declare the structure of your
        GUI, connect it to the data of your program (which should be
        a well defined set of objects) and control how this structure
        is transformed into a specific layout in a very generic way.

      * Automatically keep widget and object states in sync (in both
        directions), even with complex data structures with a lot of
        internal dependencies, object nesting etc.

    This manpage describes the facilities of Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory objects
    which are only a small part of the whole framework. To get a full
    introduction and overview of how this framework works refer to
    Gtk2::Ex::FormFactory::Intro.
